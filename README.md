Seven-Languages-Caesar-Cipher
=============================

A relatively simple Caesar cipher, coded in: Scala, Pascal, Fortran, Cobol, Lisp, Erlang, and ML.

This was completed for Marist College's Theory of Programming Languages course tuaght by Alan. As for the specific langauges used:

Free Cobol, 
Common Lisp, 
Fortran 2003, 
Scala, 
SML, 
Erlang, 
Free Pascal

The goal was to create a simple Caesar cipher, with encrypt, decrypt, and solve functions using any variant of the language necessary.
